                <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>I am a graduate of modern languages and am fluent in Spanish, Italian and Catalan. You might, therefore, wonder why I've changed career path to something so different - some days I even ask myself the same question.</p>
                <p>It's a long story but, without going into unnecessary detail, it all stemmed from my experiences during A-Level computing and the current world of tech. As a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed graduate of European Languages, I felt that the world was my oyster and couldn't wait to travel.</p>
                <p>After some time, and several job interviews, I dropped everything and decided to pick up a programming language. I had no goal nor idea where it would get me, I simply wanted to learn something that excited me and made me happy doing. After a while, I had completed an introduction to Python and SQL and was thoroughly enjoying it, and wanted to take the next step. I, therefore, applied to futureproof.</p>
                <p>Futureproof was the next step in changing my career path from modern languages to programming languages, and I was keen to secure a place to make the most of this opportunity. From there I underwent 13 weeks as a Trainee Full Stack Developer, and created a number of projects with my peers using a range of programming languages such as Python and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I have recently graduated from the programme, and in the meantime have been creating projects myself, as well as improving those I produced on the course. <a href="/projects">Check out my live websites here to view them.</a></p>
